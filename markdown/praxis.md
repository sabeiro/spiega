# programming praxis

The key principles for a proper collaborative programming are:

* clearness - readability
* testing
* debugging
* scalability of code
* modular: reusability of code, libraries

# libraries

# classes

# naming convention

* function names should tell the purpose of the function (not only a feature)
* varibles should contain the structure type when possible (file_path, file_name, file_byte, file_type)


# testing

lint: static code analysis
unit: test of the single unit (function, class)


# collaborative programming

# versioning

# environment

## virtual environment

Using a vitual environment helps handling incompatigle library versions. Usually each service ends into a separated container and hence the virtual is redundant. In some cases for local development can be useful although makes space management more difficult.

## .env

## export variables

```python
"""
 function that does a lot
